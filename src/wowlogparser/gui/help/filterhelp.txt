Description of event filters
-----------------------------------------------

-- Source Filter --
The text entered here is matched versus the source name.

-- Destination Filter --
The text entered here is matched versus the destination name.

-- All fields filter --
If any field in an event matches this text, then it is shown, otherwise not.

-- Logical expression --
This is an expression that looks like a mathematical expression with & and | () etc. A filter is specified with an expression in the form key="value". The " symbols are needed around the value. Multiple expressions can be written with & (logical and), | (logical or) between them. Expressions can also be surrounded with parenthesis to specify the order more explicitly.

The things that can be searched for in the Logical expression field:
Source name:
keys: sourcename, sname
Operations: =

keys: destinationname, destname, dname

Skill name:

Skill id:
